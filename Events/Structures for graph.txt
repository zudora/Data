    * Place
     
        can have "and" and "or" relationships with following transitions (see below in arcs) 
        "and" relation discoverable when pairs can be executed in either order, but both are always there
            example in log: {a, b, c}{a, c, b}
            maximal pairs: {a, [b, c]} {b, c}{c, b}
            counterexample: pair {a, [b, c]} alone implies that a is followed by either b or c, but doesn't contain parallelism       
            chain for {a, [b, c]} alone is (a, [b|c]). When parallelism appears, chain is (a, [b&c]).
     
     
    * Transition
     
        Local state change
        Name is event name
        Do not have "and" or "or" relationships. All arcs are required if transition fires
        Has:
			Name
			One or more input arcs
			One or more output arcs
     
     * Arc
    
        Arcs are directed edges
        Arcs connect places to transitions and transitions to places. Can't have place-place or transition-transition arcs. 
        Input:
            Places can have multiple input arcs. These are different ways of reaching a place (OR relationship) 
            Transitions can have multiple input arcs. The inputs must all be enabled before transition can fire (AND relationship)
        Output:
            Places can have multiple output arcs. These are different choices for transitions (OR relationship)
            Transitions can have multiple output arcs. When a transition fires, all arcs are followed (AND relationship)
